## Objective:

To come up with a methodology to detect redundant questions when two questions are compared. 
This can be used to improve the effectiveness of using a question answer forum like quora.

## Recurrent Neural Network (in progress)

A recurrent neural network implementation using Keras

Later (in development), the RNN will take word-embeddings as input
